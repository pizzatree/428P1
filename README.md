## About

AR Application that has nonsensical representations of New York, New York and Rome, Italy in miniature souvenir form.  
The application fixes these 3D knickknacks / doodads / souvenirs on top of marker cubes (found below).  
These cubes display the weather, an interactive magic 8 cube (rotate 180Â° in one direction, then back), and some visual elements that (obscurely) represent their respective areas.  
These cubes can also be affixed to a plane using Vuforia's plane recognition - in this mode, the cubes are static but much larger.
